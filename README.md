# kaggle_plant_FGVC7
This repo stores my deep model and its training and predicting procedures for the kaggle plant pathology competition.  
I have tried to incorperate different deep CNN models including:  
Resnet50  
InceptionV3  
DenseNet121  
EfficientNetB6  
with pretrained weights, to compare their performance.  

To mitigate overfitting, I've used techniques such as: dropout, image augmentation,  
and ealystopping at quite intense degrees.
